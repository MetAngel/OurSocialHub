        <h2 class="sustainability-h2" >What we're doing about it:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Diversity & Inclusion board</li>
                <p>
                While The Social Hub has always been a workplace that welcomes people from all backgrounds, sexual orientations, cultures and religions, they're taking concious steps to measure and improve their own diversity and inclusion internally through workshops, surveys, leadership support and targeted strategies for inclusive hiring.
                </p>

            <li>Impact Scholarships</li>
                <p>
                Their various impact scholarships offers students from lower socio-economic backgrounds the opportunity to stay at their locations for free so they can focus on their studies. With the hubs acting as both a playground and home for inspiration and growth, their impact scholarships help students lay a foundation for their bright futures.
                </p>

            <li>Awareness Days</li>
                <p>
                The Social Hub embraces and promotes a range of awareness days. From International Women's Day to Mental Health Day, Black History Month, World Refugee Day and more. Through panel talks, lectures and documentary screenings, they raise awareness and educate their community.
                </p>

            <li>Movement on the Ground</li>
                <p>
                They're continually commited to their longstanding partnership with Movement on the Ground, a non-profit organisation co-founded by the CEO of The Social Hub. More than just humanitarian aid, this organisation transforms refugee camps into healing environments for people who are forced to flee their homes.
                </p>

        </ol>
