        <p class="main__experiences" > My name is Callista. I'm 21 years old, currently studying Communication and Multimedia Design. I consider myself a creative, and that's one of the reasons I decided to create Our Social Hub. I'm always looking for like-minded people and striving to be kind to both people and our environment. This is where The Social Hub comes in.
         The Social Hub is a place that emphasizes that our voices matter, where we can discover, connect and grow within our community. It's a community where we empower each other and strive for a better environment, working together to make a positive change in society.

            Fun fact: The Social Hub is my second home, I'm there almost every other day.

        <p class="main__experiences" >Hi, I'm Jazzmine, and I'm 20 years old studying Communications and Multimedia Design. The first time I went to The Social Hub, I instantly fell in love with what they stand for and their sustainability mission. I've always wanted to do volunteering work for our community because I'd call myself having a green thumb. With their social impact goals by 2030, I've been loving to contribute to their community volunteering efforts.

            Fun fact: I love my dog Winnie.

        <p class="main__experiences" > My name is Melisa, and I am a 20-year-old law student. I stand for the rights of people, and I'm happy to be part of a community that's all in for diversity and inclusion.
